"You are a coding assistant. Your role is to read through the `instructions.md` file and implement each stage of the project step by step. Once each action is completed, update the `instructions.md` to show it being checked off in the checkboxes provided. Follow the instructions thoroughly and completely; do not miss steps or deviate from the plan unless instructed to."

1. **Project Setup**  
   - [ ] **Initialize Project Repository:** Create a new project directory (if not already created) for the code. Initialize a Git repository in this directory (e.g., run `git init` in the project folder). This will track changes as you implement each step.  
   - [ ] **Create .gitignore:** In the project directory, create a file named `.gitignore` with entries to ignore unnecessary files (e.g., `__pycache__/`, `.vscode/`, or other editor/OS-specific files). This ensures that only relevant code and files are tracked by Git.  
   - [ ] **Create README:** Add a `README.md` file in the project root. Include a brief project description or title (e.g., "# Project Name" and one-line summary). This will help others understand the project at a glance.  
   - [ ] **Create Main Script:** Create a Python script file `main.py` in the project directory. This will be the entry point of the project. In this file, set up a basic structure (e.g., a `main()` function or simple script flow) that will later be expanded with project features.  
   - [ ] **Set Up Logging:** In `main.py`, import the `logging` module and configure basic logging. Use `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(levelname)s:%(message)s')` to enable debug-level messages and a simple format for log output ([Logging HOWTO — Python 3.13.2 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#:~:text=logging)). This will ensure all debug/info messages are shown in the console. After configuring logging, add a test log message like `logging.info("Logging is configured and main.py is running.")`.  
   - [ ] **Test Logging Setup:** Run the `main.py` script to verify that logging is working. The console should display the info log message from the previous step (e.g., `INFO:Logging is configured and main.py is running.`). Ensure that this message appears, confirming that the logging configuration is correct.  
   - [ ] **Initial Commit:** Once the logging setup is verified, stage the new files (`main.py`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`) and commit them to the repository. Use a descriptive commit message, for example: _"Initial project structure with logging configuration"_. Make sure the commit is successful before proceeding.

2. **Data Loading Feature**  
   - [ ] **Prepare Sample Data:** Create a sample data file named `data.csv` in the project directory to simulate input data for the project. For example, add the following lines to `data.csv` (representing simple sales data):  
     ```csv
     Day,Sales
     1,100
     2,150
     3,200
     ```  
     Save the file. This will serve as input for the data loading function. (Ensure this file is tracked by Git so it can be used in testing, but do not commit until the feature is verified.)  
   - [ ] **Implement Data Load Function:** In `main.py`, implement a function `load_data(filepath)` that opens and reads `data.csv`. Use Python's built-in `csv` module or simple file I/O to read the contents. The function should parse each line (skipping the header) and return a list of records. For example, it can return a list of tuples or dicts for each row (e.g., `[("1", 100), ("2", 150), ...]`). Make sure to handle conversion of numeric values (e.g., convert the "Sales" string to an integer).  
   - [ ] **Add Logging in Data Load:** Inside `load_data`, after reading the file, add a log statement to confirm the result. Use `logging.info` to log a message indicating the number of records loaded, for example: `logging.info(f"Loaded {len(records)} records from {filepath}")`. This will help trace that the data was read correctly.  
   - [ ] **Integrate Data Load in Main:** In the main execution flow of `main.py` (for example, under an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block or in the `main()` function), call `load_data("data.csv")` and store its result in a variable (e.g., `data = load_data("data.csv")`). After calling it, log an info message indicating that data loading was successful, for example: `logging.info("Data loading completed successfully.")`. You might also log or print the data itself or the first record to verify the content.  
   - [ ] **Test Data Loading:** Run `main.py` to test the data loading feature. The program should read `data.csv` and log the number of records loaded. Verify the console output includes the expected log message with the correct count (for the sample data, it should report "Loaded 3 records from data.csv"). Also verify no errors occur and the data structure returned by `load_data` contains the expected data (e.g., three records with values 100, 150, 200).  
   - [ ] **Commit Data Load Feature:** Once the data loading function works correctly (the log shows the correct number of records and the data structure is as expected), stage the changes (`main.py` and `data.csv`) and commit them. Use a commit message like _"Add data loading function and sample data file"_. Ensure the commit is successful before moving to the next feature.

3. **Total Calculation Feature**  
   - [ ] **Implement Calculation Function:** In `main.py`, implement a function `calculate_total(data)` that computes the total sum of the sales values from the data list produced by `load_data`. The `data` argument could be the list of tuples or dicts from the previous step. Iterate over the records and accumulate the sum of the sales figures. For example, if `data` is a list of tuples `(day, sales)`, sum up all `sales` values. Ensure the function returns the total (an integer or float).  
   - [ ] **Add Logging in Calculation:** Inside `calculate_total`, add a logging statement to confirm the calculation. Use `logging.debug` or `logging.info` to log the computed total, e.g.: `logging.info(f"Total sales calculated: {total}")`. This provides a trace of the internal computation result. For more detailed logging, you could log each value as it’s added (using `logging.debug`), but for now logging the final sum is sufficient.  
   - [ ] **Use Calculation in Main:** In the main flow of `main.py`, after loading the data (from step 2), call the `calculate_total(data)` function and store its result (e.g., `total_sales = calculate_total(data)`). Then log an info message with the result, for example: `logging.info(f"Total sales: {total_sales}")`. This will output the total to the console for verification.  
   - [ ] **Test Total Calculation:** Run `main.py` to verify the total calculation feature. The program should load the data and then calculate the total sales. Check the console output for the total sales log. For the sample data provided, the total should be 450 (since 100+150+200 = 450). You should see a log like "Total sales: 450". Verify that this value is correct and that the program has no errors.  
   - [ ] **Commit Total Feature:** After confirming the total calculation works properly (the logged total matches the expected sum), commit the changes. Stage the modified `main.py` (since `data.csv` was already added in the previous commit) and commit with a message such as _"Implement total sales calculation feature"_.

4. **Average Calculation Feature**  
   - [ ] **Implement Average Function:** Still in `main.py`, implement a new function `calculate_average(data)` that computes the average of the sales values. Use the total from `calculate_total` or compute sum internally, then divide by the number of records. Make sure to handle the case of empty data (to avoid division by zero). The function should return the average as a float.  
   - [ ] **Add Logging in Average:** Inside `calculate_average`, add a log statement for the result. For instance: `logging.info(f"Average sales calculated: {average}")`. This will log the computed average value. If the average is not an integer, it will likely be a float; that’s expected. (With the sample data, the average should be 150.0.)  
   - [ ] **Use Average in Main:** In the main flow, after obtaining the total sales, call the new `calculate_average(data)` function. Store its result (e.g., `avg_sales = calculate_average(data)`) and then log an info message to report the average, for example: `logging.info(f"Average sales: {avg_sales}")`. This will allow you to see the average in the console output.  
   - [ ] **Test Average Calculation:** Run `main.py` again to test the average calculation. The program should output the total sales (as before) and additionally the average sales. Verify the logged average is correct. For the sample data (total 450 over 3 records), the expected average is 150.0. The console should show a message like "Average sales: 150.0". Ensure this matches the calculation and that no errors occur during execution.  
   - [ ] **Commit Average Feature:** Once the average calculation is verified to be correct, commit the changes to `main.py`. Use a commit message like _"Add average sales calculation feature"_. Make sure all changes are saved and committed before proceeding.

5. **Final Testing and Documentation**  
   - [ ] **Full Run Verification:** Perform a final full run of the program (`python main.py`). This run should execute all the implemented features: loading data, calculating total sales, and calculating average sales. Observe the log output to ensure that each step is reported: "Loaded ... records", "Total sales: ...", and "Average sales: ...". Confirm that the outputs are correct and in the expected order. This final test ensures that integrating all features together works without issues.  
   - [ ] **Code Review & Cleanup:** Review the code in `main.py` and other files for any improvements or cleanup. Ensure that all logging statements are appropriate (using `logging.debug` for very detailed messages and `logging.info` for high-level messages). Remove or adjust any overly verbose debug logs if not needed. Also, ensure the code is well-structured (functions have clear purposes) and add comments or docstrings to functions where appropriate for clarity. For example, add a short docstring to `load_data`, `calculate_total`, and `calculate_average` describing what they do and their return values.  
   - [ ] **Final Commit:** If any changes were made during the cleanup or documentation step, stage those changes and commit them (e.g., _"Refactor and add documentation comments"_). Ensure that the `README.md` is up to date if more description of the project is needed (you can add a Usage section describing how to run `main.py` and what it does). Finally, verify that all tasks in this `instructions.md` file are completed and checked off. At this point, the project implementation is finished, and every step has been verified and committed.
